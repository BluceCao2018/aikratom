## AI opportunity: Use Cursor to assist, complete patent application in 1 hour
Yesterday, I used Cursor to assist and completed the patent application in about an hour. The process was so smooth. There may be many professional traps that I didn't discover, but the process did go through quickly.

Of course, the premise is that I don’t have high expectations for the feasibility of this “patent” itself, so I just want to complete this action and try it out. The actual process is as follows:

1. I didn’t even know whether I should apply for an “invention patent” or a “design” patent. I asked Cursor to read the project code and act as a professional patent lawyer to provide me with advice. He suggested that I choose “invention patent”; and told How should I apply and what materials need to be prepared;

2. When applying on the Patent Office website, the "claims", "specification" and "abstract" are all written directly by Cursor, because the data of this kind of official document in the large model corpus is sufficient and good, so in my humble opinion Based on my experience, I judge that Claude’s writing is really good;

3. Patent applications require drawings. Originally, Cursor suggested that I find someone to hire a professional organization to help draw it, because it naturally believed that it could not draw pictures; but I know that this kind of flow chart can be generated by the code of a large model and then converted into graphics. So I asked it to do it for me directly.  

4. When I encountered some flowcharts that were inconsistent with the expected effects, I threw the images back to Cursor to let him understand the difference between the image effects generated by the current code and the expected effects, and let him make corrections.  


If this matter is done by an agency, I estimate that the communication time will be far more than 1 hour, especially when you want to clearly explain the background of the project and provide sufficient information on the project implementation logic. With large models to help, you just throw in a few code files as context. After a while, when the application progresses, I will synchronize it to see how it works.
