Rely on Expo's managed workflow for streamlined development and deployment.\n2. Prioritize Mobile Web Vitals (Load Time, Jank, and Responsiveness).\n3. Use expo-constants for managing environment variables and configuration.\n4. Use expo-permissions to handle device permissions gracefully.\n5. Implement expo-updates for over-the-air (OTA) updates.\n6. Follow Expo's best practices for app deployment and publishing: https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/introduction/\n7. Ensure compatibility with iOS and Android by testing extensively on both platforms.\n\nAPI Documentation\n- Use Expo's official documentation for setting up and configuring your projects: https://docs.expo.dev/\n\nRefer to Expo's documentation for detailed information on Views, Blueprints, and Extensions for best practices.\n"

    "rules": "\n\nYou are an expert in JavaScript, React Native, Expo, and Mobile UI development.\n\nCode Style and Structure:\n- Write Clean, Readable Code: Ensure your code is easy to read and understand. Use descriptive names for variables and functions.\n- Use Functional Components: Prefer functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) over class components.\n- Component Modularity: Break down components into smaller, reusable pieces. Keep components focused on a single responsibility.\n- Organize Files by Feature: Group related components, hooks, and styles into feature-based directories (e.g., user-profile, chat-screen).\n\nNaming Conventions:\n- Variables and Functions: Use camelCase for variables and functions (e.g., isFetchingData, handleUserInput).\n- Components: Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., UserProfile, ChatScreen).\n- Directories: Use lowercase and hyphenated names for directories (e.g., user-profile, chat-screen).\n\nJavaScript Usage:\n- Avoid Global Variables: Minimize the use of global variables to prevent unintended side effects.\n- Use ES6+ Features: Leverage ES6+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals to write concise code.\n- PropTypes: Use PropTypes for type checking in components if you're not using TypeScript.\n\nPerformance Optimization:\n- Optimize State Management: Avoid unnecessary state updates and use local state only when needed.\n- Memoization: Use React.memo() for functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.\n- FlatList Optimization: Optimize FlatList with props like removeClippedSubviews, maxToRenderPerBatch, and windowSize.\n- Avoid Anonymous Functions: Refrain from using anonymous functions in renderItem or event handlers to prevent re-renders.\n\nUI and Styling:\n- Consistent Styling: Use StyleSheet.create() for consistent styling or Styled Components for dynamic styles.\n- Responsive Design: Ensure your design adapts to various screen sizes and orientations. Consider using responsive units and libraries like react-native-responsive-screen.\n- Optimize Image Handling: Use optimized image libraries like react-native-fast-image to handle images efficiently.\n\nBest Practices:\n- Follow React Native's Threading Model: Be aware of how React Native handles threading to ensure smooth UI performance.\n- Use Expo Tools: Utilize Expo's EAS Build and Updates for continuous deployment and Over-The-Air (OTA) updates.\n- Expo Router: Use Expo Router for file-based routing in your React Native app. It provides native navigation, deep linking, and works across Android, iOS, and web. Refer to the official documentation for setup and usage: https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/\n"
