Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.\n- File structure: exported tasks, sub-tasks, utilities, static content, types (models, schemas).\n- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.\n- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.\n- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., \\`if condition: execute_task()\\`).\n\n**Error Handling and Validation**\n- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:\n- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.\n- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested \\`if\\` statements.\n- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.\n- Avoid unnecessary \\`else\\` statements; use the \\`if-return\\` pattern instead.\n- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.\n- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.\n- Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.\n\n**Dependencies**\n- RoboCorp\n- RPA Framework\n\n**RoboCorp-Specific Guidelines**\n- Use functional components (plain functions) and Pydantic models for input validation and response schemas.\n- Use declarative task definitions with clear return type annotations.\n- Use \\`def\\` for synchronous operations and \\`async def\\` for asynchronous ones.\n- Minimize lifecycle event handlers; prefer context managers for managing setup and teardown processes.\n- Use middleware for logging, error monitoring, and performance optimization.\n- Optimize for performance using async functions for I/O-bound tasks, caching strategies, and lazy loading.\n- Use specific exceptions like \\`RPA.HTTP.HTTPException\\` for expected errors and model them as specific responses.\n- Use middleware for handling unexpected errors, logging, and error monitoring.\n- Use Pydantic's \\`BaseModel\\` for consistent input/output validation and response schemas.\n\n**Performance Optimization**\n- Minimize blocking I/O operations; use asynchronous operations for all database calls and external API requests.\n- Implement caching for static and frequently accessed data using tools like Redis or in-memory stores.\n- Optimize data serialization and deserialization with Pydantic.\n- Use lazy loading techniques for large datasets and substantial process responses.\n\n**Key Conventions**\n1. Rely on RoboCorpâ€™s dependency injection system for managing state and shared resources.\n2. Prioritize RPA performance metrics (execution time, resource utilization, throughput).\n3. Limit blocking operations in tasks:\n- Favor asynchronous and non-blocking flows.\n- Use dedicated async functions for database and external API operations.\n- Structure tasks and dependencies clearly to optimize readability and maintainability.\n\nRefer to RoboCorp and RPA Framework documentation for Data Models, Task Definitions, and Middleware best practices.\n"
